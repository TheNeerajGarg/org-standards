# Example: Repository-Specific Quality Gate Overrides
#
# Copy this file to quality-gates.local.yaml in your repo root (NOT in org-standards/)
# and customize as needed. This file is NOT committed to git (.gitignore'd).
#
# Use cases:
# - Lower threshold for specific code types (CLI wrappers, data pipelines)
# - Disable optional gates (mypy for JavaScript projects)
# - Add repo-specific gates (security scanning for production services)

# Example 1: Lower coverage threshold for this repo
gates:
  coverage:
    threshold: 60  # Override org-wide 80%

# Example 2: Disable type checking (for Python 2 projects or gradual typing)
# gates:
#   type_checking:
#     enabled: false

# Example 3: Add repo-specific omit patterns
# gates:
#   coverage:
#     omit_patterns:
#       - "playground/*"
#       - ".ai-sessions/*"
#       - "*/tests/*"
#       - "*/__pycache__/*"
#       - "migrations/*"      # Add repo-specific pattern
#       - "legacy_code/*"     # Add repo-specific pattern

# Example 4: Increase timeout for slow test suites
# gates:
#   testing:
#     timeout_seconds: 600  # 10 minutes (override 5 minutes)
