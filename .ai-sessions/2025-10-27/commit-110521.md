# Introspection: Exclude Markdown Files from Trailing Whitespace Check

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Type**: policy-change
**Focus**: Exclude .md files from trailing-whitespace pre-commit check

---

## Purpose

Exclude markdown files from trailing-whitespace check in pre-commit config.

**Rationale**: Markdown files are documentation, not code. Trailing whitespace
doesn't affect rendering and causes unnecessary CI failures.

**User decision**: "Option 1. Ensure it is done in a way that goes to all repo.
So, likely a change in org standard"

---

## Challenges Encountered

None - straightforward config change.

---

## Mistakes Made

**Should have done this from the start**: Treating documentation the same as
code created unnecessary friction (3+ CI failures for whitespace in .md files).

---

## How to Avoid Next Time

### What Human Could Have Done Differently

**User correctly identified the issue**: Asked whether we should have different
standards for introspection files and .md files vs code.

**Right question**: "Should we have different standard for introspection files?
They are not code. Similarly for .md files"

### What Bot Could Have Done Differently

**Should have questioned the policy earlier**: After the second whitespace
failure, should have proposed excluding .md files instead of continuing to fix
individual files.

### What System Could Have Done Differently

**Policy now updated**: .md files excluded from trailing-whitespace check.

**Propagation**: This change in org-standards will automatically apply to:
- Syra (main branch, submodule update)
- StyleGuru (stable branch, submodule update)
- All future repos using org-standards

**Future**: Consider documenting "code vs documentation" quality standards
distinction in org-standards README.
