# Introspection: Pre-commit Hook - Add Schema Validation

**Session**: 2025-10-27
**Commit Hash**: 5571342 (pending)
**Type**: Enhancement
**Repo**: org-standards

## What Was the Problem?

Adding schema validation to pre-commit hook as part of artifact storage optimization. This commit adds introspection document schema validation to ensure all introspection docs have required sections.

**Context**:
- Part of multi-repo artifact storage optimization
- Current pre-commit hook only checks if introspection file exists
- No validation of content/schema (missing sections can slip through)
- Need to enforce required sections: What/Why/How to Prevent

**Change Made**:
- Added schema validation block in pre-commit hook (lines 62-81)
- Validation runs after file existence check, before auto-staging
- Uses Python validation script (scripts/validate-introspection.py)
- BLOCKING: Commits fail if schema is invalid

---

## Why Did It Happen?

**Root Cause**: Original pre-commit hook implementation only checked for file existence, not content quality.

**Context I Lacked**: None - following documented plan from Syra's `.claude/ARTIFACT-STORAGE-STATUS.md`

**Assumptions I Made**:
- ✅ Python 3 is available in all environments (checked with `command -v python3`)
- ✅ Validation script exists in repos that use this hook
- ✅ Blocking validation is appropriate (not just warning)

---

## How Could It Have Been Prevented?

**What I Could Have Done Differently**:
- N/A - This is the correct implementation

**What Would Help Prevent This Class of Issue**:
- Graceful degradation: Hook should skip validation if script missing (already implemented - checks `if [ -f "scripts/validate-introspection.py" ]`)
- Clear error messages: Shows which sections are missing (already implemented)

**Changes to CLAUDE.md or Process**:
- N/A - No process improvements needed

---

## Impact Assessment

**Blast Radius**: Medium - Affects all repos using org-standards pre-commit hook
**Risk**: Low - Validation only blocks if content actually invalid
**Rollback**: Easy - Remove lines 62-81 from pre-commit hook

---

## Testing Plan

**Verification**:
```bash
# After propagation, test in Syra:
1. Create test commit with invalid introspection (missing section)
   - Should be BLOCKED with clear error message

2. Create test commit with valid introspection
   - Should pass validation and commit successfully

3. Verify validation script handles edge cases:
   - File not found (should block)
   - Empty file (should block)
   - Valid file (should pass)
```

## Propagation Notes

**Repos to Update**:
1. ✅ org-standards (this commit)
2. ⏳ Syra (update submodule reference + add validation script)
3. ⏳ StyleGuru (update submodule reference + add validation script)

**Files to Propagate**:
- org-standards/git-hooks/pre-commit (this file)
- scripts/validate-introspection.py (from Syra)

## Related Context

- **Status Document**: Syra `.claude/ARTIFACT-STORAGE-STATUS.md`
- **Validation Script**: Created in Syra `scripts/validate-introspection.py`
- **Part of**: Multi-repo artifact storage optimization (Priority 2: Schema Validation)
- **Estimated Impact**: Ensures all introspection docs follow standard format (100% schema compliance)
