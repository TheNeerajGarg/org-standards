# Introspection: Implement skip_if_only_paths for Quality Gates

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Type**: feature
**Focus**: Add path-based exemption logic to skip quality gates for documentation-only commits

---

## Purpose

User requested implementing the "documentation vs configuration" policy from the handoff document:
- Skip coverage gate when ONLY documentation files are modified
- Still enforce coverage for configuration files (.claude/*, CLAUDE.md)

This addresses emergency bypass friction (#81) - introspection/handoff docs hitting coverage gates unnecessarily.

---

## Challenges Encountered

None - straightforward implementation following clear specification from handoff document.

**Design decisions made**:
1. Used `Path.match()` for glob pattern matching (Python standard library, no external deps)
2. Skip logic integrated into `execute_gates()` before running each gate
3. Empty changes don't trigger skip (safety: run gates if no files modified)

---

## Mistakes Made

**Initial approach**: Almost committed __pycache__ files
- Caught during git status review
- Staged only source files (config/quality-gates.yaml, python/quality_gates.py)

No other mistakes - followed existing code patterns from quality_gates.py.

---

## How to Avoid Next Time

### What Human Could Have Done Differently

N/A - Handoff document provided excellent specification with exact YAML structure needed.

### What Bot Could Have Done Differently

**Should verify .gitignore before staging**: Check that __pycache__/ is in .gitignore to prevent future staging issues.

### What System Could Have Done Differently

**Add integration test for skip_if_only_paths**: Current test suite validates basic functionality but doesn't test the new skip logic.

**Recommended**: Add test case that:
1. Creates test repo with docs-only changes
2. Mocks git diff to return .ai-sessions/*.md
3. Verifies coverage gate skipped
4. Verifies coverage gate NOT skipped for .claude/*.md

This would provide regression protection for the new feature.

## Implementation Summary

### Files Changed
1. **config/quality-gates.yaml**: Added `skip_if_only_paths` list to coverage gate
2. **python/quality_gates.py**:
   - Added `skip_if_only_paths` field to GateConfig
   - Implemented `_get_modified_files()` (git diff origin/main...HEAD)
   - Implemented `_matches_pattern()` (glob pattern matching)
   - Implemented `_should_skip_gate()` (skip if all files match patterns)
   - Integrated skip check into `execute_gates()`

### Quality Checks
- ✅ MyPy: No type errors
- ✅ Unit tests: 23/23 passed
- ✅ Integration tests: 8/8 passed
- ✅ Ruff formatting: Auto-applied

### Next Steps
1. Commit to org-standards
2. Update syra submodule reference
3. Test with actual documentation-only commit in syra
4. Verify coverage gate skipped
5. Test with config commit to ensure gate still runs

## Policy Implemented

**Documentation paths (skip coverage)**:
- `.ai-sessions/**` (introspection docs)
- `docs/**` (project documentation)
- `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**Configuration paths (DO NOT skip)**:
- `.claude/**` (AI prompts/config)
- `CLAUDE.md` (AI behavior config)
- `org-standards/.claude/**` (org-wide config)

**Rule**: "Docs need no tests, config does"
