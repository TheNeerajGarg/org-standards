# Principal Engineer Review: Stage-Aware Quality Gates

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Reviewer**: Principal Engineer (AI Agent)
**Document**: design-stage-aware-quality-gates.md
**Verdict**: **CONDITIONAL APPROVE**

## ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Sound Philosophy**: "Strictest by default, relax as needed" (opt-out) is architecturally correct
2. **Clear Problem Statement**: Articulates real pain point with concrete user requirements
3. **Well-Researched Options**: Three distinct approaches with honest trade-off analysis
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Design genuinely maintains backward compatibility
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Avoids config sprawl
6. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Stage relaxations explicitly declared in YAML
7. **Good Testing Strategy**: Unit tests validate relaxation application logic
8. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Migration path, examples, risks/mitigations documented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL Concerns

### 1. Semantic Inversion Risk - "Relaxations" Can Tighten

**Problem**: Nothing prevents relaxations from making requirements stricter:
```yaml
coverage:
  threshold: 70  # Base
  stage_relaxations:
    push-to-main:
      threshold: 85  # Oops, "relaxation" is STRICTER
```

**Impact**: Violates "Base = HIGHEST STANDARD" principle

### 2. No Validation That Base Is Actually Strictest

**Problem**: Nothing enforces base config represents highest standard
**Gap**: Developers could define `stage_relaxations.push-to-main`

### 3. Stage Detection Auto-Default to "pre-push" is Dangerous

**Problem**: Comment says "assume pre-push" but code returns None
**Edge Case**: Manual execution gets strictest standard, not pre-push relaxations

### 4. "stage_relaxations" Naming Doesn't Prevent Misuse

**Issue**: Name implies loosening but implementation allows any override

### 5. Push-to-Main Detection Fragile

**Gap**: Doesn't handle custom protected branch names

## üîß Recommendations

### CRITICAL (BLOCKERS)

1. **Add validation that relaxations don't tighten requirements**
   - Prevent `stage_relaxations.push-to-main` anti-pattern
   - Validate threshold relaxations lower bar
   - Validate required relaxations don't make optional gates required

2. **Add stage name validation against allowlist**
   - Catch typos like `pre_push` ‚Üí silent failure
   - Fail-fast with clear error

3. **Clarify stage=None behavior**
   - Fix misleading comment
   - Add test validating manual execution uses base config

### Additional Recommendations

4. Keep "stage_relaxations" name BUT add validation
5. Make branch names configurable (future)
6. Add emergency bypass stage tracking
7. Add stage-level summary view tool
8. Add integration test for unknown stage

## üìä Risk Assessment

- **Blast Radius**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Reversibility**: MODERATE
- **Recommendation**: **CONDITIONAL APPROVE**

**Conditions**:
1. Implement validation (BLOCKER)
2. Add stage name validation (BLOCKER)
3. Clarify stage=None behavior (BLOCKER)
4. Add test coverage for validation failures (SHOULD FIX)

**Rollout Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Implement with validation (no config changes)
- Phase 2: Add stage_relaxations to syra (canary, 48 hours)
- Phase 3: Roll out to other repos

**Estimated Time with Fixes**: 5-6 hours (was 3-4 hours)
