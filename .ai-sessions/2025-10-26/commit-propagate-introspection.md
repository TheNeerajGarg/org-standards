## What Was the Problem?

The org-standards propagate workflow commits to dependent repos (Syra, StyleGuru, playground) but wasn't creating introspection docs. This would cause commits to fail in repos with introspection enforcement (like Syra).

## Why Did It Happen?

**Context I Lacked**:
- Didn't initially audit org-standards workflows when fixing bot introspection
- Focused only on Syra's local bot workflows

**Assumptions I Made**:
- That org-standards propagation would be exempt from introspection
- That only local bot workflows needed updates

**Patterns I Followed**:
- Completed Syra bot workflows first
- Only checked org-standards when user asked "Is it applying to all repos?"

## How Could It Have Been Prevented?

**AI Could Have**:
- Searched ALL repos for workflows that commit (not just current repo)
- Asked: "Should I check org-standards workflows too?"
- Used grep across org-standards: `grep -r "git commit" org-standards/.github/workflows/`

**Human Could Have**:
- Specified "Check all repos including org-standards" in original request
- Mentioned propagation workflow explicitly

**System Could Have**:
- Cross-repo workflow analysis tool
- List all workflows that commit to other repos

## Actionable Changes

**Workflow Updates Made**:
- [x] Added introspection doc creation step to propagate-to-repos.yml
- [x] Stage .ai-sessions/ along with org-standards submodule
- [x] Follows same pattern as Syra bot workflows

**org-standards Propagation Pattern**:
- Bot creates introspection doc in target repo's .ai-sessions/
- Target repo's pre-commit hooks will validate the introspection doc
- Complete audit trail of all automated changes across repos

**New Questions to Ask**:
- [ ] "Should I search all organization repos for workflows that commit?"
- [ ] "Are there other cross-repo workflows I should check?"

## Pattern Recognition

**Similar Issues**:
- Same as Syra bot workflows - all automated commits need introspection
- Cross-repo workflows are easy to miss when focused on single repo

**Recurring Theme**:
- Comprehensive search required: grep across ALL repos, not just current
- Ask about scope: "Just this repo or all repos?"
