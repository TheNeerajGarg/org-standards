# Introspection Log: Rename fashion-extract to StyleGuru in Code References

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-23
**Project**: org-standards
**Context**: Update hardcoded path references from "fashion-extract" to "StyleGuru" in Python and shell files

---

## What Was Done

Replaced hardcoded path references to "fashion-extract" with "StyleGuru" in code files:

**Python files (1 total):**
- `scripts/validate_mcp_config.py` (Line 195) - Repository path reference in validate_all_repos()

**Shell files (1 total):**
- `scripts/setup-neerajdev-workspace.sh` (Lines 54, 76) - REPOS array and workspace structure display

**NOTE**: `scripts/validate_mcp_config.py` was untracked (new file not yet committed), added to git.

Total: 2 code files updated (1 Python + 1 shell).

## Challenges Encountered

None - straightforward replacement in org-standards repository.

## Mistakes Made

None - followed the proven systematic process:
1. Created backup branch
2. Replaced all .py and .sh files with fashion-extract references
3. Verified zero references remaining
4. Created introspection document
5. Ready to commit to both main and stable branches

## How to Avoid Next Time

Process continues to work perfectly. This completes the organization-wide rename across all 4 repositories:
- ✅ syra-playground (13 .md files)
- ✅ StyleGuru (183 .md + 209 code files)
- ✅ syra (78 .md + 6 code files)
- ✅ org-standards (13 .md + 2 code files)

Total: 287 .md files + 217 code files renamed across the organization.

## Learnings Applied

- org-standards serves as shared infrastructure for all repos
- Changes here affect both main branch (syra-playground) and stable branch (StyleGuru)
- Need to commit to both branches to ensure all parent repos have updated submodule
- Small number of code files (2) but critical infrastructure scripts
- validate_mcp_config.py was never committed previously - adding it now as part of this change
