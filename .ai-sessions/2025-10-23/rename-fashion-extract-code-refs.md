# Introspection Log: Rename fashion-extract to StyleGuru in Code References

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-23
**Project**: org-standards (stable branch)
**Context**: Update hardcoded path references from "fashion-extract" to "StyleGuru" in shell files

---

## What Was Done

Replaced hardcoded path references to "fashion-extract" with "StyleGuru" in code files:

**Shell files (1 total):**
- `scripts/setup-neerajdev-workspace.sh` (Lines 54, 76) - REPOS array and workspace structure display

**NOTE**: `scripts/validate_mcp_config.py` does not exist on stable branch (only on main branch).

Total: 1 code file updated (1 shell script).

## Challenges Encountered

None - straightforward replacement in org-standards stable branch.

## Mistakes Made

None - followed the proven systematic process:
1. Created backup branch
2. Replaced fashion-extract references in shell script
3. Verified zero references remaining
4. Created introspection document
5. Ready to commit and push to stable

## How to Avoid Next Time

Process continues to work perfectly. This completes the organization-wide rename across all 4 repositories and both org-standards branches (main and stable):
- ✅ syra-playground (13 .md files) - uses org-standards main
- ✅ StyleGuru (183 .md + 209 code files) - uses org-standards stable
- ✅ syra (78 .md + 6 code files)
- ✅ org-standards main (13 .md + 2 code files)
- ✅ org-standards stable (13 .md + 1 code file)

Total: 287 .md files + 218 code files renamed across the organization.

## Learnings Applied

- org-standards stable branch serves StyleGuru (production repo)
- org-standards main branch serves syra-playground (development/testing)
- Different branches have different file sets (validate_mcp_config.py only on main)
- Both branches needed updates to ensure all parent repos have correct references
- Small number of code files on stable (1) but critical infrastructure script
