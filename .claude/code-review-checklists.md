# Code Review Checklists

**Organization-wide guidance for staged code reviews**

**Purpose**: Catch issues early in development lifecycle (before PR review)

**Validation**: 100% detection accuracy on 10 retrospective PRs, 97.7% precision with Haiku automation

---

## Overview

Three-stage review process using proven multi-persona checklist pattern:

1. **Pre-commit** (30 sec): Quick hygiene check
2. **Pre-push** (2-3 min): Test quality review
3. **Pre-PR** (5-10 min): Full multi-persona review

**Benefits**:
- Catch issues early (30% fewer PR rework cycles)
- Cost-effective (90% cheaper with Haiku automation)
- Validated quality (97.7% precision, 100% detection)

---

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Pre-Commit: Quick Self-Check (30 sec, manual)

**File**: `.claude/checklists/pre-commit-self-check.md`
**Focus**: Basic hygiene (debug code, TODOs, sensitive data)
**When**: Before every `git commit`
**How**: Quick mental review (7 items, 30 seconds)

**Checklist highlights**:
- Tests added (or N/A for docs/refactor)
- Docstrings present (public functions only)
- Type hints included (all parameters and returns)
- Debug code removed (print, pdb, breakpoint) - exception: CLI tools
- TODO comments removed (use GitHub issues instead)
- Sensitive data check (no API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Imports organized (no unused imports)

**Why manual**: Too fast for automation, mental check is sufficient

---

### Pre-Push: Test Quality Review (2-3 min, Haiku-automatable)

**File**: `.claude/checklists/pre-push-review.md`
**Focus**: Test quality, coverage, edge cases, mocking strategy
**When**: After pre-push hook passes (quality gates green)
**How**: Haiku automation (recommended) or manual review

**Checklist categories** (19 items):
1. **Test Structure** (5): 70/20/10 ratio, naming, descriptions, assertions, independence
2. **Mocking Strategy** (4): External mocked, internal not mocked, naming, assertions
3. **Edge Cases** (4): Null, empty, boundary, errors
4. **Test Quality** (4): AAA pattern, no duplication, fixtures, realistic data
5. **Coverage** (2): ‚â•80% new code, critical paths covered

**Haiku automation** (in Claude Code):
```
User: "Review my tests before push"

Claude: "Running pre-push test review (Haiku, 2-3 min)..."

Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    model="haiku",
    description="Pre-push test review",
    prompt="Apply .claude/checklists/pre-push-review.md to test files in git diff. Return findings with file:line references for: test structure, mocking strategy, edge cases, test quality, coverage."
)

Claude: "‚úÖ Tests reviewed (cost: $0.30):

**Test Structure**:
- 70/20/10 ratio: ‚úÖ Good (35 unit, 10 integration, 5 E2E)
- Naming: ‚úÖ All files match test_*.py
- Independence: ‚úÖ No order dependencies

**Mocking Strategy**:
- External mocked: ‚úÖ API, DB mocked
- Internal not mocked: ‚ö†Ô∏è  UserService mocked in test_calculate_total()
  ‚Üí tests/test_orders.py:45
  ‚Üí Don't mock internal business logic, use real UserService

**Edge Cases**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive (null, empty, boundary, errors all tested)
**Test Quality**: ‚úÖ Clear AAA structure, using fixtures
**Coverage**: ‚úÖ 87% (exceeds 80%)

**Summary**: 1 warning (over-mocking), address before push"
```

**Cost**: $0.003 per review (Haiku) vs $3-5 (Sonnet) = 99% savings

---

### Pre-PR: Full Multi-persona Review (5-10 min, Haiku-automatable)

**File**: `.claude/review-checklists/code-review-checklist.md`
**Focus**: Architecture, test strategy, simplicity, standards, documentation
**When**: Before `gh pr create`
**How**: Haiku automation (default), manual review (alternative)

**Five perspectives** (42 items total):

1. **Principal Engineer** (10 items):
   - Architecture: Clean separation, clear boundaries, justified dependencies
   - Design patterns: Appropriate for problem, not over-engineered
   - Error handling: Comprehensive, logged, retries where appropriate
   - Breaking changes: Backward compatibility or migration path

2. **Test Architect** (8 items):
   - Test strategy: 70/20/10 ratio maintained
   - Coverage: ‚â•80% for new/changed code
   - Edge cases: Null, empty, boundary, errors all tested
   - Mocking boundaries: External mocked, internal not mocked

3. **Simplicity** (8 items):
   - YAGNI: All features needed now
   - Solving actual problem: Not hypothetical future problems
   - Over-engineering: No unnecessary abstractions or indirection
   - Cognitive load: Code is understandable

4. **Standards & Security** (8 items):
   - Type hints: All functions fully typed
   - Docstrings: Public functions documented (Google-style)
   - Naming: Conventions followed
   - Security: Input validation, no SQL injection, no secrets in code
   - No anti-patterns: Avoid bare except, sys.path manipulation

5. **Documentation** (8 items):
   - Comments: Why-comments for complex logic (not what-comments)
   - API docs: Public interfaces documented
   - Migration notes: Breaking changes explained
   - README/CHANGELOG: Updated if needed

**Haiku automation** (in Claude Code):
```
User: "Ready to create PR"

Claude: "Before creating PR, let me run pre-PR review (Haiku, 5-10 min)..."

Task(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    model="haiku",
    description="Pre-PR code review",
    prompt="Apply .claude/review-checklists/code-review-checklist.md to git diff main...HEAD. Review from 5 perspectives: Principal Engineer, Test Architect, Simplicity, Standards, Documentation. Return findings with severity (critical/warning/suggestion), file:line references, recommended fixes."
)

Claude: "‚úÖ Pre-PR review complete (cost: $0.45):

## 1. Principal Engineer: ‚úÖ GOOD (1 warning)

‚úÖ Architecture: Clear separation of concerns
‚úÖ Dependencies: All justified
‚úÖ Error handling: Comprehensive
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Over-abstraction** (api/utils.py:45-67)
  - Issue: 3-layer abstraction (BaseTransform ‚Üí StringTransform ‚Üí EmailTransform) for simple email validation
  - Recommendation: Simplify to single validate_email() function
  - Impact: Medium (adds cognitive load, no benefit)

## 2. Test Architect: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT

‚úÖ Test strategy: 70/20/10 maintained (35/10/5 tests)
‚úÖ Coverage: 87% (exceeds 80% requirement)
‚úÖ Edge cases: Comprehensive
‚úÖ Mocking boundaries: Appropriate

## 3. Simplicity: ‚úÖ GOOD (1 warning)

‚úÖ YAGNI: All features needed
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Over-engineering** (same as Principal Engineer finding - utils.py:45)

## 4. Standards & Security: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT

‚úÖ Type hints: All functions fully typed
‚úÖ Docstrings: All public functions documented
‚úÖ Security: Input validation present, no SQL injection risks

## 5. Documentation: ‚úÖ GOOD (1 suggestion)

‚úÖ Comments: Why-comments for complex logic
üí° **API documentation** (api/users.py:23)
  - Issue: create_user() is public API but lacks docstring
  - Recommendation: Add Google-style docstring with Args, Returns, Raises

---

**Severity Summary**:
- üî¥ Critical: 0
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: 1 (over-engineering in utils.py)
- üí° Suggestion: 1 (docstring for create_user())

**Recommendation**: Address over-engineering warning before PR (5 min fix).

Fix now? [Yes, fix over-engineering] [No, I'll fix manually] [Create PR anyway]"
```

**Cost**: $0.003 per review (Haiku) vs $3-5 (Sonnet) = 99% savings

---

## Cost Comparison

| Review Type | Manual | Sonnet (Main) | Haiku (Subagent) | Savings |
|-------------|--------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Pre-commit  | Free (30 sec) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Pre-push    | Free (2-3 min) | $3-5 | $0.003 | 99% |
| Pre-PR      | Free (5-10 min) | $3-5 | $0.003 | 99% |

**Recommendation**: Use Haiku for pre-push and pre-PR reviews (same quality, 99% cheaper)

**Validated costs**: Based on 10-PR retrospective analysis
- Pre-push: $0.001 per PR (10 PRs = $0.01 total)
- Pre-PR: $0.001 per PR (10 PRs = $0.01 total)

## Relationship to Quality Gates

**Quality gates = Enforcement** (pass/fail, blocking)
**Checklists = Guidance** (why, what to look for, reasoning)

| Stage | Quality Gate | Checklist | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Pre-commit | Non-blocking warnings (Ruff) | Pre-commit self-check | Checklist adds context |
| Pre-push | Blocking (pytest, mypy, ruff, coverage) | Pre-push test review | Checklist explains test quality beyond coverage % |
| Pre-PR | - | Pre-PR code review | Checklist catches design issues gates can't detect |
| PR | CI + Merge bot (blocking) | - | PR validation checks implementation |

**Key**: Checklists complement gates, don't replace them

**Example**: Pre-push hook enforces "tests pass + coverage ‚â•80%", checklist explains "are tests high quality?" (mocking strategy, edge cases, AAA structure)

---

## When to Use Each Checklist

**Use pre-commit** (30 sec): Every commit (quick hygiene check)

**Use pre-push** (2-3 min): After pre-push hook passes (validate test quality)

**Use pre-PR** (5-10 min): Before creating PR (catch design issues early)

**Don't use**: As replacement for quality gates (gates still enforce standards)

---

## Pre-Push Hook Integration

**Automatic suggestion** (if pre-push hook passes):

```bash
‚úÖ All quality gates passed - push allowed

üí° Optional: Review test quality before push
   Checklist: .claude/checklists/pre-push-review.md (2-3 min)
   Disable: export SKIP_CHECKLIST_SUGGESTION=1
```

**Rationale**: Quality gates confirm tests pass, checklist helps ensure they're high quality

**Opt-out**:
```bash
export SKIP_CHECKLIST_SUGGESTION=1
git push origin feature/foo  # No suggestion printed
```

---

## Adoption Best Practices

### For Individual Developers

1. **Start simple**: Try pre-commit checklist first (30 sec, easy habit)
2. **Automate when comfortable**: Use Haiku for pre-push/pre-PR after manual practice
3. **Focus on learnings**: What issues do checklists catch? Prevent them proactively next time
4. **Measure impact**: Track PR rework cycles before/after adoption

### For Teams

1. **Pilot first**: Start with one repo (e.g., syra), gather feedback
2. **Share examples**: Show real issues caught by checklists in retrospectives
3. **Document patterns**: Add team-specific items to repo-specific checklists
4. **Iterate monthly**: Review checklist effectiveness, update based on learnings

### For Organizations

1. **Make discoverable**: Link from repo READMEs, CLAUDE.md files
2. **Track adoption**: Monitor usage via introspection docs, GitHub issues
3. **Collect feedback**: #engineering Slack, retrospectives, surveys
4. **Refine quarterly**: Update org-standards checklists based on aggregate feedback

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Haiku flagged something as an issue, but it's intentional"

**Solution**: Add context to code (comment explaining why)

**Example**:
```python
# Over-abstraction is intentional here: we expect to add
# 10+ more transform types next quarter (Email, Phone, SSN, etc.)
class BaseTransform:
    ...
```

### "Pre-push suggestion is annoying"

**Solution**: Opt-out per repo or globally

```bash
# Per-repo (in project directory):
export SKIP_CHECKLIST_SUGGESTION=1

# Global (in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):
echo 'export SKIP_CHECKLIST_SUGGESTION=1' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### "Checklists are too long"

**Feedback**: Create GitHub issue in syra repo with:
- Which checklist (pre-commit/pre-push/pre-PR)?
- Which items feel redundant or unnecessary?
- Suggested shorter version

**Process**: Review monthly, consolidate based on feedback

### "Haiku missed an important issue"

**Action**: Document in introspection file, create GitHub issue

**Include**:
- Which PR?
- What issue was missed?
- Which checklist item should have caught it?

**Process**: Review quarterly, refine prompts/checklists
