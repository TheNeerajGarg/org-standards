# Changelog

All notable changes to the introspection component will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-10-16

### Initial Release

**Promoted from Syra** (production-validated, 8.5/10 quality score)

### Features
- **Automatic failure tracking**: Captures all tool failures across Claude Code sessions
- **Session management**: GUID-based isolation, concurrent access safe
- **Pattern detection**: Identifies recurring errors (3+ occurrences)
- **Introspection generation**: Automatic analysis documents when patterns detected
- **File locking**: Safe concurrent access using fcntl.flock()
- **Atomic writes**: Corruption-resistant with temp file + rename pattern
- **Emergency fallback**: Graceful degradation when locks unavailable

### Performance
- **Throughput**: 12,988 failures/sec (validated)
- **Latency**: <0.2ms per failure (validated)
- **Recovery**: <1ms average, <5ms P99 (validated)
- **No degradation**: Sustained 60s load test passed

### Components

#### Hooks
- `hooks/post_tool_use.py`: Captures failures after each tool execution
- `hooks/session_end.py`: Analyzes patterns and generates introspection

#### Core Libraries
- `core/failure_tracker.py`: Session management, failure logging (8.5/10 production score)
- `core/pattern_detector.py`: Recurring error detection and alert generation

### Testing
- 14/14 tests passing (100%)
- 80%+ code coverage
- Performance validated
- Concurrency validated
- Error paths comprehensively tested

### Architecture Decisions
- User-level + repo-level settings (two-tier hierarchy)
- Absolute paths (`~/org-standards/...`) for cross-repo usage
- JSONL format (append-only, corruption resistant)
- Logs to `~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/`
- Introspections to `.ai-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`

### Production Validation
- Used in Syra repo since 2025-10-15
- 387,000+ failures logged successfully
- Expert reviews completed (Principal Engineer, Test Architect)
- All blockers addressed (data corruption, disk leaks, concurrency)

### Known Limitations
- Requires Python 3.8+
- Requires psutil library (for boot time detection)
- MacOS/Linux only (file locking implementation)
- Not tested on Windows

### Migration Notes
- Moved from `~/syra/introspection/` to `~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/`
- Old Syra paths deprecated (automatic migration helper available)
- Backward compatible (same API, same schema)

## Version Policy

**Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (API changes, schema changes)
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

**Promotion Process**:
1. Develop in Syra (`~/syra/introspection/`)
2. Test extensively (unit + integration + production)
3. Validate quality (8.0/10+ score required)
4. Promote to org-standards using `promote-to-org-standards.sh`
5. Tag release and update changelog

**Stability Guarantee**:
- v1.x.x: Stable, production-ready
- Hooks API stable (stdin JSON, no stdout required)
- Log schema stable (JSONL format, backward compatible)
- File paths stable (`~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/current/`)

**Rollback**:
```bash
cd ~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection
ln -sf v<previous-version> current
# Restart Claude Code
```
