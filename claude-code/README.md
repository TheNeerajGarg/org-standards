# Claude Code Organization Standards
## Automatic Failure Tracking and Introspection

---

## 🚀 Quick Start for Developers

### Option 1: One-Line Setup (Recommended)

**Copy-paste this into your terminal**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StyleGuru/org-standards/main/claude-code/activate-introspection.sh | bash
```

Then **restart Claude Code**. Done!

**What it does**:
- ✅ Clones org-standards (if not present)
- ✅ Configures introspection hooks
- ✅ Validates everything works
- ✅ Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

**Time**: 2-5 minutes

---

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to see each step:

```bash
# 1. Clone org-standards (if not already)
git clone git@github.com:StyleGuru/org-standards.git ~/org-standards

# 2. Run idempotent setup script
cd ~/org-standards
./claude-code/activate-introspection.sh

# 3. Restart Claude Code
#    - Close Claude Code completely
#    - Reopen Claude Code

# 4. Verify it works
python -c "import nonexistent"
tail ~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/*/failures.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Expected output**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T...",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "error_type": "module_not_found",
  "error_message": "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nonexistent'",
  "exit_code": 1
}
```

## Overview

**What**: Automatic failure tracking for all Claude Code sessions across the organization

**Where**: Works in ALL repositories (Syra, StyleGuru, any project) - no per-repo setup needed

**When**: Active after one-time setup per developer/machine (2-5 minutes)

**Why**: Organization-wide learning from mistakes, pattern detection, prevention

**How**: Lightweight hooks (<0.2ms overhead) automatically log all command failures

---

## What Gets Tracked

### Automatic Failure Logging

**Every tool failure across ALL repos**:
- ❌ Bash commands (exit code ≠ 0)
- ❌ File operations (permission denied, not found)
- ❌ Python imports (ModuleNotFoundError)
- ❌ Tests (pytest failures)
- ❌ Linting (ruff, mypy errors)

**Logged to**: `~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/session-{guid}/failures.jsonl`

### Pattern Detection

**When session ends**:
- Detects recurring errors (3+ same error)
- Generates introspection document
- Saves to: `.ai-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/session-{guid}-introspection.md`

---

## How It Works

### Architecture

```
User works in ANY repo (StyleGuru, Syra, etc.)
         ↓
Claude Code executes tools (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
         ↓
Tool fails (exit_code ≠ 0 or stderr exists)
         ↓
PostToolUse hook fires (automatic)
         ↓
Hook calls: ~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/hooks/post_tool_use.py
         ↓
Failure logged to: ~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/session-{guid}/failures.jsonl
         ↓
Session ends
         ↓
SessionEnd hook analyzes patterns
         ↓
If patterns found → generates introspection document
```

### Configuration

**User-level settings** (`~/.claude/settings.local.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 ~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/hooks/post_tool_use.py"
      }]
    }],
    "SessionEnd": [{
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 ~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/hooks/session_end.py"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Why user-level**: Works across ALL repos without per-repo configuration.

## Components

### Hook Scripts

**`introspection/hooks/post_tool_use.py`**:
- Runs after every tool execution
- Checks if failure occurred
- Logs to failure tracker
- <0.2ms overhead (negligible)

**`introspection/hooks/session_end.py`**:
- Runs when Claude Code session ends
- Analyzes failure patterns
- Generates introspection document if patterns detected

### Core Libraries

**`introspection/core/failure_tracker.py`**:
- Session management (GUID-based isolation)
- Failure logging (JSONL format)
- File locking (concurrent access safe)
- Atomic writes (corruption resistant)
- Production-validated (8.5/10 score)

**`introspection/core/pattern_detector.py`**:
- Recurring error detection
- Command failure grouping
- Alert generation

---

## Organization Benefits

### Individual Developer

- ✅ Learn from mistakes (automatic introspection)
- ✅ Detect patterns (3+ same errors → alert)
- ✅ Faster debugging (all failures in context)
- ✅ Better habits (aware of recurring issues)

### Team

- ✅ Share learnings (common patterns in standups)
- ✅ Improve standards (update docs based on data)
- ✅ Prevent waste (catch repeated mistakes)
- ✅ Data-driven decisions (which errors most common)

### Organization

- ✅ Institutional knowledge (patterns documented)
- ✅ Training data (for AI prompts/docs)
- ✅ Quality metrics (track error reduction)
- ✅ Proactive prevention (fix root causes)

---

## Maintenance

### Storage

**Typical usage**: 1-5 MB/day (varies by error rate)
**Location**: `~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/`
**Retention**: Sessions archived automatically after 7 days

### Cleanup (Automatic)

```bash
# Handled by failure_tracker.py
# Sessions older than 7 days → archived
# Archives older than 30 days → deleted
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks Not Firing

**Check 1**: Is org-standards cloned?
```bash
ls ~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/hooks/post_tool_use.py
# Should exist
```

**Check 2**: Are settings configured?
```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.local.json
# Should show hooks configuration
```

**Check 3**: Did you restart Claude Code?

### Failures Not Logged

**Check recent sessions**:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/
tail -5 ~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/*/failures.jsonl
```

**Test manually**:
```bash
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","exit_code":1,"stderr":"test"}' | \
  python3 ~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/hooks/post_tool_use.py

tail -1 ~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/*/failures.jsonl
```

---

## For New Developers

### What You Need to Do

**One command** (copy-paste):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StyleGuru/org-standards/main/claude-code/activate-introspection.sh | bash
```

Then **restart Claude Code**. That's it!

---

### Detailed Onboarding Checklist

If you want to understand each step:

1. **Run the setup script** (handles everything automatically):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StyleGuru/org-standards/main/claude-code/activate-introspection.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code**:
   - Close Claude Code completely
   - Reopen Claude Code
   - Hooks are now active!

3. **Verify it works** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Generate a test failure
   python -c "import nonexistent"

   # Check if it was logged
   tail ~/.claude/failure-tracker/sessions/*/failures.jsonl | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

4. **Done!** Introspection now works in ALL repos you work on (Syra, StyleGuru, any project).

**Time**: 2-5 minutes

---

### What the Script Does

The `activate-introspection.sh` script is **fully idempotent** and handles:

- ✅ Clones org-standards if not present (or creates symlink if found elsewhere)
- ✅ Checks if already configured → skips if done
- ✅ Migrates from old Syra paths → automatic backup + update
- ✅ Validates configuration → JSON syntax, paths, hook execution
- ✅ Updates if needed → detects outdated, offers to pull
- ✅ Safe to run repeatedly → no side effects

**What this means for you**: Just run the command, answer a few prompts, restart Claude Code. Everything else is automatic.

---

## Migration from Syra

### If You Currently Use Syra Introspection

**Old paths** (Syra-based):
```json
"command": "python3 ~/syra/introspection/hooks/post_tool_use.py"
```

**New paths** (org-standards):
```json
"command": "python3 ~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection/hooks/post_tool_use.py"
```

**Migration**:
```bash
# Backup old settings
cp ~/.claude/settings.local.json ~/.claude/settings.local.json.backup

# Update paths
sed -i '' 's|~/syra/introspection|~/org-standards/claude-code/introspection|g' \
  ~/.claude/settings.local.json

# Restart Claude Code
```

---

## Philosophy

### Why in org-standards?

**Proper separation**:
- ✅ org-standards = Organization-wide tooling and standards
- ✅ Syra = Product code (bot infrastructure for Syra project)
- ✅ StyleGuru = Product code (fashion AI engine)

**Benefits**:
- No dependency on product repos
- Works for developers who don't touch Syra
- Clear ownership (org-wide infrastructure team)

### Design Principles

**Standards should be**:
- ✅ Battle-tested (proven in production, 8.5/10 score)
- ✅ Minimal (only essential dependencies)
- ✅ Documented (comprehensive guides)
- ✅ Evolving (improved based on learnings)

---

## Technical Details

### Performance

- PostToolUse: <0.2ms per failure
- SessionEnd: 50-200ms (runs at exit)
- Overall impact: <0.1% overhead

### Concurrency Safety

- File locking with fcntl.flock()
- GUID-based session isolation
- Atomic writes (temp file + rename)
- Stale lock detection (crash recovery)

### Testing
